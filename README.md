# Drowsiness Detection
The objective of this project is to read facial expression and see if the face is drowsy or not sleepy and beep an alarm if face looks drowsy.

## Usefulness
It is very useful as a lot of accidents happen due driver feeling sleepy. As sleepiness can be detected through facial muscle movement like yawning, eye closing, it can be detected easily through facial recognition. If we find any symptom of driver feeling sleepy, we'll beep an alarm which will wake him up instantaneously and reduce the chance of accident. In today's world there is a need of effective system like this. It is just a prototype and will work on it.

### Procedure
- Collection of dataset.
- Creation of classifier model with the best possible accuracy.
- Deployment of classifier with the help of opencv


Happy coding!!!
